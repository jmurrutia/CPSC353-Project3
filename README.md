// Assignment 3: Rectilinear traveling salesperson problem: exhaustive optimization algorithm  
// Jose M. Urrutia  
// A special case of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the input is a rectilinear graph  
// INPUT: a positive integer n and a list P of n distinct points representing vertices of a rectilinear graph  
// OUTPUT: a list of n points from P representing a Hamiltonian cycle of minimum total weight for the graph  
  
// Assignment 3: Rectilinear traveling salesperson problem: improved nearest neighbor algorithm  
// Jose M. Urrutia  
// A special case of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the input is a Euclidean graph  
// INPUT: a positive integer n and a list P of n distinct points representing vertices of a Euclidean graph  
// OUTPUT: a list of n points from P representing a Hamiltonian cycle of relatively minimum total weight for the graph
